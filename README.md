# Github Search Profies

> **This project is a challenge of the [app ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) project**.

In this project i used

- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- API Public of the [Github](https://api.github.com/users)

### About the challenge

Um desafio consistia em criar uma aplicação web que utilizando a Api do GitHub buscasse os usuarios de acordo com o nome digitado no input.

#### Minimum requirements of the challenge

- User can enter a username.
- User can click on search button to retrive information.
- User can see the avatar, username, followers and repository count of de searched user.
- User can see the top 4 repositories of searched user.
- User should get an alert if the username is not valid.

#### Bonus features

- User can toggle dark/light mode.
- Selected mode should persist when user comes back to the app again.

Besides the bonus challenges, I also made a fake cache so that if the user searches again for the same name he would look up that user in the localStorage, and not have to redo a new request.
